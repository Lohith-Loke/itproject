# Hospital Mapping and Recommendation System
## Abstract
The project aims at providing the easy, efficient and accountable system by making a Command line
application which manages everything from recommending and mapping patient to hospital to the final
billing.
So, the program uses user’s location and hospital’s location from database to give list of nearest hospitals.
User can choose department based on the disease user has and then doctors who are available. As the
patient get admitted, room is allotted to him/her. Then the lab tests given by doctor are performed on
patient.
Later, all the lab tests that are done, doctors and hospital and patient details are added to patient’s
medical record. Medical record also has all the data about the diseases patient previously had. Using all
these data in medical records bill is calculated.
Program uses concept of Object-Oriented Programming and for implementing OOPs we use Java
programming language.
